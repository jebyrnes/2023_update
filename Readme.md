### To Replicate our Analysis
In order to replicate analysis from the paper, code in the scripts folder is enumerated in the order it should be run. We have tried to provide brief overviews and comment our code in order to facilitate understanding of precisely what we did. The code was developed via collaboration between Pérez-Matus and Byrnes.

For specific questions, feel free to contact jarrett.byrnes@umb.edu. We welcome any pull requests with additional code comments that users find helpful to better understand what we did.


### Directories
- `data`: Contains both raw data mined from the literature and derived data generated by data processing scripts. See `data/Readme.md` for more.

- `figures`: Contains figures generated by processing scripts.

- `scripts`: Containst [R](http://r-project.org) scripts to generate analysis. Scripts are numbered in order to run them in order to generate figures, tables, and information in the paper.

### Funding
Funding was provided by the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) working group on ["Global impacts of climate change on kelp forest ecosystems."](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/workinggroups/global-impacts-climate-change-kelp-forest-ecosystems)
